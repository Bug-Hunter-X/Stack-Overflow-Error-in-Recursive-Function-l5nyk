# Stack Overflow Error in JavaScript Recursive Function
This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive JavaScript functions: stack overflow. The `myFunction` recursively calls itself without a proper base case for large inputs, leading to exceeding the call stack limit.
The solution involves adding a check to prevent excessive recursion, improving the efficiency of the code.
